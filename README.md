# Cyberpunk Corpo Website

A real website for a fictional cyberpunk corporation.

# Inspiration

This web development project was originally inspired by my favorite fiction book, "Neuromancer" by William Gibson.

# Objective

In terms of objectives, the primary goal is to build and deploy a website which is indistinguishable from a company site for a real organization.

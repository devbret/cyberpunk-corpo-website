This project is a fictional corporate website set in a cyberpunk universe, built to feel like a real company’s public-facing presence. Using Three.js as a core visual layer, the site leans into neon-lit, high-tech atmosphere with interactive 3D elements.

The goal is to blend sharp UI/UX, modern frontend architecture and stylized scene work into a cohesive brand experience.

Beyond the aesthetic, the site is a playground for experimenting with production-level web techniques in a narrative wrapper. Inspired by Neuromancer, the project treats worldbuilding as a design constraint, pushing every component to reinforce the corporate mythos and create a convincing “real fake” product.
